# TriageCall Analyser — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement TriageCall Analyser.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (always provide)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — 6 milestone instructions

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components
- `sections/` — 5 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build milestone by milestone:

1. Copy `product-plan/` to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in section variables (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build everything at once:

1. Copy `product-plan/` to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste into your coding agent
4. Answer clarifying questions
5. Let the agent implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes `tests.md` with test-writing instructions:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md`
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement to make tests pass
4. Refactor while green

The tests are **framework-agnostic** — adapt to your setup.

## Milestones

1. **Foundation** — Design tokens, data model, routing, shell
2. **Authentication** — Sign-in, sign-up, password reset
3. **Call Input** — Transcript input and processing
4. **Analysis Results** — 4-step wizard
5. **Scorecard** — 9-competency breakdown
6. **History** — Past analyses list

## Tips

- **Use the prompts** — They include important clarifying questions
- **Build incrementally** — Catch issues early
- **Review thoroughly** — Check implementations carefully
- **Fill in gaps** — Backend logic may need additions
