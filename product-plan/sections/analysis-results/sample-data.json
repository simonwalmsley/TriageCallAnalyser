      "title": "Missed Opportunity to Explore the Budget Objection",
      "description": "At 4:32, the prospect said \"I'm not sure we have the budget for this right now\" and the rep moved immediately to discussing payment plans rather than exploring the objection.",
      "impact": "This was the critical moment where the call's direction was determined. The prospect had just revealed they were experiencing significant pain with their current situation. By jumping to solutions instead of deepening the problem awareness, the rep lost leverage and the prospect's buying temperature dropped noticeably.",
      "evidence": "The prospect's tone shifted from engaged to hesitant after this exchange, and subsequent questions were met with shorter, more guarded responses."
