# TriageCall Analyser

## Description
TriageCall Analyser is an AI-powered coaching tool that analyses sales triage calls and pinpoints the single highest-leverage moment for improvement—delivering instant, evidence-backed feedback with a clear rule for the next call.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Slow Skill Development
Sales reps repeat mistakes and improve slowly because diagnosing call quality is manual and delayed. TriageCall provides instant AI analysis, replacing the wait of days for feedback and accelerating rep improvement.

### Problem 2: Subjective Coaching
Managers interpret performance subjectively, leading to inconsistent feedback. TriageCall delivers structured scoring across 9 competencies with evidence directly from the call, removing guesswork.

### Problem 3: Overwhelming Feedback
Traditional reviews surface too many issues at once, paralyzing reps. TriageCall focuses on the single highest-leverage moment, making improvement actionable and achievable.

### Problem 4: No Self-Coaching Ability
Reps must wait for manager availability to get feedback. TriageCall enables reps to analyse their own calls immediately, building self-awareness and autonomy.
